Concepts Notes on Stats

# What is Statistics?

Statistics is a mathematical science including methods of collecting, organizing and analyzing data in
such a way that meaningful conclusions can be drawn from them. In general, its investigations and
analyses fall into two broad categories called descriptive and inferential statistics.
# Developing Statistical Thinking

Statistics include numerical facts and figures. For instance:

• The largest earthquake measured 9.2 on the Richter scale.

• Men are at least 10 times more likely than women to commit murder.

• One in every 8 Americans is COVID positive.

The study of statistics involves math and relies upon calculations of numbers. But it also relies heavily on how the
numbers are chosen and how the statistics are interpreted. For example, consider some scenarios and the
interpretations based upon the presented statistics.

1. A new advertisement for Amul’s ice cream introduced in late May of last year resulted in a 30% increase in ice
cream sales for the following three months. Thus, the advertisement was effective.
2. The more liquor shop in a city, the more crime there is. Thus, liquor shops lead to crime.

1. Flaw: A major flaw is that ice cream consumption generally increases in the months of June, July, and
August regardless of advertisements. This effect is called a history effect and leads people to interpret
outcomes as the result of one variable when another variable (in this case, one having to do with the
passage of time) is actually responsible.
2. Flaw: A major flaw is that both increased liquor shops and increased crime rates can be explained by
larger populations. In bigger cities, there are both more liquor shops and more crime. This problem refers
to the third-variable problem. Namely, a third variable can cause both situations; however, people
erroneously believe that there is a causal relationship between the two primary variables rather than
recognize that a third variable can cause both.

Hence, the correct Interpretation of the numbers are necessary!!!!

# Types of Statistics:

1. Descriptive statistics deals with the processing of data without attempting to draw any
inferences from it. The characteristics of the data are described in simple terms. Events that are
dealt with include everyday happenings such as accidents, prices of goods, business, incomes,
epidemics, sports data, population data.

2. Inferential statistics is a scientific discipline that uses mathematical tools to make forecasts
and projections by analysing the given data. This is of use to people employed in such fields as
engineering, economics, biology, the social sciences, business, agriculture and
communications.
